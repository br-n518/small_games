title=Example.

  # Create Room 1 and Room 2, and link them together.
  # Room 1 is the first room ever listed, so player starts there.
door=Room 1,Room 2

  # Create Bob and place him in Room 1.
  # Have him say "Hello World!", "How are you?" when talked to (without quotes)
  # These quotes let you type anything you want. Below is another example.
person=Bob,Room 1
"Hello World!"
"How are you?"

!Bob
Hello World!
How are you?
  # Also valid, but can't use # or = in dialogue without quotes.

  # Create an item called 'Fish' and give it directly to the player.
  # Make the fish 'edible' with an ampersand (&)
item=&Fish,player

  # Create a heavy stove the player can't pick up with an exclamation mark (!).
item=!Stove,Room 2

  # Create a normal basic item, but put it in the same room as the player
item=Leaf,here

  # Searches same directory as previously listed.
include=filename
  #Example:
  #include=folder1/file1
  #include=file2
  # Actually loads folder1/file2
  # To remove folder name, use:
  # include=./file2

  # Make a spooky message at beginning when player enters Room 1
trigger=Room 1
$ person say Turn back!

  # Do the same thing in Room 2, using a procedure (proc).
proc=spooky_text
$ person say Turn back!

trigger=Room 2
$ @spooky_text

  # Reset Bob's dialogue and trigger, then set new ones
!Bob
$ item add &Fish:here
"Here, have a fish."

  # What will happen:
  # Room 1 and Room 2 are created, connected, and Room 1 has Bob.
  # Bob will NOT say Hello World because it's overwritten with "Here, have a fish."
  # Both rooms say "Turn back!" when you enter them.
  # Bob "gives you" (drops on the floor) an edible fish each time you talk to him.
  # If there's no file named "filename" then the game says it can't find the file.

  # Bob could've instead done "item add &Fish:player" to put it in the player's inventory.
